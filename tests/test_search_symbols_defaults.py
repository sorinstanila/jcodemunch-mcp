"""Regression tests for §1.1 (detail_level="auto") and §1.2 (token_budget ordering).

These back the v2.0.0-alpha behavior changes in search_symbols:
  §1.1 — default detail_level flips from "standard" to "auto", which resolves
         to "compact" for broad discovery and "standard" otherwise.
  §1.2 — full-mode payload is materialized BEFORE budget packing, so
         token_budget is actually respected when detail_level="full".
