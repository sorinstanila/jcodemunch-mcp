    Metrics (all stored at index time — no re-parsing required):
        cyclomatic   — branch count; 1 = no branches, higher = more paths through the code.
        max_nesting  — deepest nesting level within the function body.
        param_count  — number of declared parameters.
        lines        — number of source lines (end_line - line + 1 when available).
        assessment   — "low" (1–4), "medium" (5–10), or "high" (11+) based on cyclomatic.

    Args:
        repo:        Repository identifier (owner/repo or bare name).
        symbol_id:   Full symbol ID as returned by search_symbols / get_file_outline.
